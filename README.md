Data Analysis and Statistics_Gridded Data:

The Berlin Wall was a barrier built by East Germany in 1961 to divide the city of Berlin and prevent its citizens from fleeing to the West. It consisted of a concrete wall, barbed wire, and guard towers, creating a heavily fortified border. The wall symbolized the ideological division of the Cold War, with East Berlin under communist control and West Berlin aligned with the West. It caused immense separation among families and friends. The wall fell on November 9, 1989, following political changes and peaceful demonstrations in East Germany. Its fall marked a significant moment in history, leading to the reunification of East and West Germany and the end of the Cold War. Remnants of the wall can still be found today as memorials in Berlin.

So, in this project we will working with the Landsat scenes over Berlin. we can download these Landsat scenes from the EarthExplorer and we will plot the RGB data and do edge detection to look for evidence of the fall of the Berlin Wall.
